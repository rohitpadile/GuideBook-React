          GuidebookX believes in helping its customers as far as possible and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 7 days of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</li>
          <li>GuidebookX does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product delivered is not good.</li>
          <li>In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same to our Customer Service team within 7 days of receipt of the products. The request will be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at their end.</li>
          <li>If the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must notify our customer service within 7 days of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team will take an appropriate decision after reviewing your complaint.</li>
          <li>For products with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue directly to them.</li>
          <li>If any refunds are approved by GuidebookX, it will take 16-30 days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.</li>
        </ul>
